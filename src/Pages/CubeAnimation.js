            Ever since writing my first program and manipulating it to produce
            my desired output, the rest has been an absolute love of code. I
            still remember sitting in front of a computer and making it print
            "hello world" for the first time on my screen. Guess what! It was
            magic to me, and since then, I have developed a strong desire to
            learn coding. There is certainly yet more to learn, yet more to
            solve, yet more to build, and for this, I am very grateful.
            Skills/interests: HTML | BOOTSRAP | ANGULAR JS | TYPESCRIPT |
            FLUTTER | UI/UX DESIGN. I am eagerly grabbing onto any other
            programming languages, frameworks, or principles to solve modern
            problems with workable solutions. Never give up. Believe in
            yourself. Be passionate. Work hard. Itâ€™s never too late. I'm just
            scratching the surface; I still have a long way to go to get to
            where I want to be. Will you help me get there?
